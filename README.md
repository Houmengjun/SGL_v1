This package provides the codes of: 
1) SGL w/o PL for SSPP with a standard biometric enrolment database (SSPP-se), run testSGL_ssppse.m; 

2) Variation dictionary learning, run GenerateVariation_SGL.m

The codes for the prototype learning are under optimization and will be released soon in the next version of code package. If you wish to get the full code of SGL or have any other questions, please contact the author with the email: mengpang@comp.hkbu.edu.hk or pangmeng@mail.dlut.edu.cn.
